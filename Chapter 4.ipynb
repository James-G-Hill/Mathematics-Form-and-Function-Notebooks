    "> It is a familiar but remarkable fact that one single scale of numbers will be applicable to each of many types of quantitative comparisons: To distance, to weight, to length, to width, to temperature, to time, to height, and so on. Once a unit is chosen, each of these magnitudes exemplifies one and the same scale: That of real numbers, considered as a scale laid out as the points of a line with chosen origin and unit point; and so emphasizing the interpretation of the scale by distances . . ."
