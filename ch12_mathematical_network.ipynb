Nodes of this network are closely bound to procedures useful in human activities and to questions arising in science. The transition from activities to the formal Mathematical systems is guided by a variety of general insights and ideas. Within the formal network, new developments are stimulated and guided by conjectures, problems, abstractions, and the constant desire to understand more."
